## Paint House

>**Question 1**

There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: `red`, `blue` or `green`. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x 3` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

>**Note**

All costs are positive integers.


>**Solution**

DP.

>**Question 2**

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x k` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

>**Note**

All costs are positive integers.

Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

>**Solution**

dp: maintain the minimum two costs min1(smallest) and min2 (second to smallest) after painting i-th house.
