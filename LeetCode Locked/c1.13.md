##Binary Tree Upside Down
>**Question**

Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

---
>**Solution**

At each node you want to assign:
p.left = parent.right;
p.right = parent;

>**Top down approach**

We need to be very careful when reassigning current node’s left and right children. Besides making a copy of the parent node, you would also need to make a copy of the parent’s right child too. The reason is the current node becomes the parent node in the next iteration.

For example:
Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},

       1  
      / \  
     2   3  
    / \  
    4  5

return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].

      4  
     / \  
    5   2  
       /  \  
      3    1
